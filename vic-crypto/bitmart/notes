Next step is to set an "index point" where the percent change will start tracking at 0, output current percent change to a file and then compare with the current percent change to see difference. Output to google sheets and use sparklines to compare. use google sheets function to move cells from one to the other and replace current cells every n minutes. This will be the perfect strategy to track top performers and trade accordingly! Use coin gecko because they have all coins!
